# Audit-Risk-Classification-
This project was part of the MIS6v99 Applied Machine Learning course that I took in Spring 2019. 

The goal of this project is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors. 

The dataset is collected from the Auditor Office of India to build a predictor for classifying suspicious firms and is publicly available on UCI's Machine Learning Repository.
